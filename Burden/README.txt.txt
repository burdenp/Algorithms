1) Python 2.7
2) No I do not believe it needs any building
   but I have not done a python executable before
3) I implemented a version of an undirected graph similar to the one
   given on in response for to midterm1, I used pythons dictionary
   object to simulate a graph
4) Yes it passes the tests, I spent a while playing with its ability to import

5) I did not run this test
6)O(n+m)
